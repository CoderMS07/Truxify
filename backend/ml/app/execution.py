"""Bounded execution helpers for CPU-bound / blocking ML work.

FastAPI async endpoints must never run CPU-bound inference or blocking I/O
directly on the event loop: a single expensive request would stall every
other request, including ``/health``.  This module provides a shared, bounded
``ThreadPoolExecutor`` plus an ``asyncio.Semaphore`` so expensive inference is
executed off the event loop with a configurable concurrency cap and
deterministic backpressure (HTTP 503 when saturated).

Configuration (environment variables):

- ``ML_MAX_CONCURRENT_INFERENCE``         max in-flight inferences (default 4).
- ``ML_INFERENCE_MAX_WORKERS``            executor threads (default 4).
- ``ML_INFERENCE_QUEUE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS``  how long a request waits for an
  inference slot before the service sheds load with 503 (default 5.0).

The executor has application/process lifetime: it is created once at import
time and reused for every request.  ``close_inference_executor`` is wired into
the FastAPI shutdown hook so no worker threads leak.

The semaphore is per event loop (weakly referenced from the running loop).
``asyncio`` primitives bind to the loop that first awaits them, and the ML
service's unit tests exercise the app across many short-lived event loops
(one per ``TestClient`` / ``asyncio.run``); a single module-level semaphore
would raise ``RuntimeError: bound to a different event loop``.  In production
uvicorn runs exactly one loop, so capacity is still shared globally.
